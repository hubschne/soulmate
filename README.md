# soulmate

Takes the survey results of a google survey (like this one)[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUhpoNNopdZ3ObCGYgFfjHg0VV1phFWylMdjpOcGTA-SJ-bA/viewform] and determines the soulmate (= participant with most matching answers).

I created this little notebook during a Data Science bootcamp. One day we were jokingly asking each other "light-hearted" preference questions like 'are you a cat or dog person' or 'pineapple on pizza yes/no' and I decided to set up a small google survey and wrote this notebook so that we could find out our bootcamp soulmates. 

Download the survey results and save in "./data/data.csv"

Suspected issue:
The script might not work if two survey participants enter the same name.
